        balcony. You can be in the water in 0-2 seconds. (This room is intended
        for couples only and not suitable for children below 18 years of age,
        due to close-by water hazards.)

        Built around a small quasi-private pool, (about 453sqm, 3ft deep, ideal
        for smaller children) these rooms have a friendly village feel suitable
        for families, singles, and large groups of all kinds. The views are
        considerably inferior to those elsewhere in the hotel but the rooms are
        more spacious.
